The "Property or method "total" is not defined on the instance but is referenced during render"

This error means the total variable is being used but is not defined in the Vue objects data, to

fix the issue, the total variable must be defined within the Vue object data. To fix the issue,
if you have already defined the variable in the Vue object, check for spelling errors.
The variable in the the Vue model must match the Vue data.
